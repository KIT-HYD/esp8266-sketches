# esp8266-sketches
Sketches for running and tesing ESP8266 as a sensor node. This stuff is our Work-In-Progress development repository for ESP8266 based sensor systems. Thus, there is no real documentation for it, but there are some projects utilizing these contents.



## Projects

There are some (one) sample project, where these scripts have been used.
